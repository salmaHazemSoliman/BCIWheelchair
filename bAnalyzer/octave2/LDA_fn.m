    %Finding the between and within-classes scatter matrices is easy for our two classes example:
    Maxclass = max(c);
    mu_total = mean(X);
    %mu = [ mean(c1); mean(c2) ];
    Sw = (X - Classes_Mu(c,:))'*(X - Classes_Mu(c,:));
    Sb = (ones(Maxclass,1) * mu_total - Classes_Mu)' * (ones(Maxclass,1) * mu_total - Classes_Mu);

    %The General Eigenvalue problem is now solved by simply doing
    [V, D] = eig(Sw\Sb);

% sort eigenvectors desc
    [D, ss] = sort(diag(D), 'descend');
    V = real(V(:,ss));
